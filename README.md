# Machine Learning and Image Processing Tutorials and Examples

## This repository contains code examples for Machine Learning and Computer Vision based on Udemy courses on Machine Learning by Jose Portilla

### Computer Vision Projects
```
1. Numpy and Image Basics   
2. Image Basics with OpenCV   
3. Image Processing   
4. Video Basics with Python and OpenCV   
5. Object Detection   
6. Template Matching
```
   
### Machine Learning Projects  
```
1. Deep Learning for Custom Images   
2. Linear Gradient Descent   
3. Regression Fitting
4. Big Data processing (Spark)
```

### SQL Project
```
Practical example on data manupulation of Multiple tables
```
   
For the deep learning course, I used python3.6

Required dependancies,external files and Annanconda Prompt Installation codes are as as follows -:

1) Open CV

   pip install opencv-python
   
2) Keras

   pip install Keras
   
3) scikit - learn

   pip install scikit-learn
   
4) Tensor Flow

   pip install --upgrade tensorflow
   
5) Data for Deep-Learning-Custom-Images.ipynb
